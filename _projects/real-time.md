This project is completed.

In this project, we developed a **real time task scheduling framework** for cloud computing using **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** and **Least Laxity First (LLF)** algorithms.  
The real time tasks were generated using the **UUNIFAST** algorithm, and the framework demonstrates how ACO-inspired scheduling can optimize resource utilization and reduce task latency.
