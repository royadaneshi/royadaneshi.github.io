This project is completed.

In this project, I developed a **UI test automation framework** using Cypress to automate end‑to‑end interactions with web applications.  
Key features include:  
- **Writing tests** in JavaScript that simulate user actions in the browser.  
- Using Cypress’s powerful assertions and automatic waiting to ensure reliable test execution.  
- **Structuring test suites** to cover critical user flows and UI components.  
- Enabling continuous integration of UI tests to maintain software quality.
