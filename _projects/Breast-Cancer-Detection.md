This project is currently ongoing.

In this project, we aim to develop a **machine learning framework** for detecting breast cancer from mammography images.  
We also integrate **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to interpret model decisions and make them understandable to clinicians and medical technicians and helping verify that the model focuses on clinically relevant regions.

The repository for this project is private as it is still in progress:
