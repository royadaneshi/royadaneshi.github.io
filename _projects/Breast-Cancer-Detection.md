<span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold;">🟢 This project is completed.</span>


In this project, we developed a **machine learning framework** for detecting breast cancer from mammography images.  
We also integrated **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to interpret model decisions and make them understandable to clinicians and medical technicians and helping verify that the model focuses on clinically relevant regions.
