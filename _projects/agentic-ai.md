<span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold;">🟡 This project is currently ongoing.</span>


In this project, we aim to develop an **agentic AI system** by designing two collaborative agents:
1. A task-solving agent for a specific game.
2. A benchmark agent that evaluates and guides the task agent’s behavior.

Together, they form a testbed for studying agentic reasoning and benchmarking AI autonomy.
