<span style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">🟢 This project is completed.</span>

In this project, we developed the **front-end of a compiler** for the **C-minus programming language**, a simplified subset of the C language commonly used for educational and research purposes in compiler design.  
The compiler performs **lexical** and **syntax analysis** to translate source code into an intermediate representation.

Key components:
- **Lexical Analyzer:** Tokenizes source code into valid symbols using defined grammar rules.  
- **Parser:** Builds a syntax tree to verify the structural correctness of programs.  
- **Error Handling:** Detects and reports lexical and syntactic errors with clear feedback.  

This project demonstrates the foundational concepts of **compiler construction**, using tools such as **Flex** and **Bison** to implement scanning and parsing stages.
