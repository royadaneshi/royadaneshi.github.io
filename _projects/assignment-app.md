In this project, we developed an **Android-based classroom management application** called **Assignment App** using Java.  
The app provides dedicated panels for **professors** and **students**, enabling efficient creation, submission, and management of university assignments.

Key features include:  
- **Login and registration system** for professors and students.  
- **Professor Panel** for creating and managing classes.  
- **Student Panel** for joining and viewing enrolled classes.  
- Intuitive navigation built with Android Fragments and Activities.  
- Scalable structure for future features such as assignments and grades.
