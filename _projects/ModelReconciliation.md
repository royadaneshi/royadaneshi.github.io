This project is currently ongoing.

In this project, we aim to develop **minimal and complete explanations** that help align a human’s mental model with an AI agent’s reasoning process.  
Our goal is to improve interpretability and trust in AI decision-making by generating explanations that are both concise and conceptually complete.

The repository for this project is private as it is still in progress:
