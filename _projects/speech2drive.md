This project is currently ongoing.

In this project, we developing a **voice‑controlled driving assistance system** that processes spoken commands and converts them into driving‑related actions.  
Key features include:  
- Capturing and transcribing spoken input via speech recognition.  
- Mapping user speech to driving commands (e.g., “turn left”, “speed up”, “stop”).  
- Integrating the processed commands with a driving simulator or vehicle control interface to enable hands‑free interaction.

The repository for this project is private as it is still in progress:
