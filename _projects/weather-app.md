This project is completed.

In this project, we developed a **weather application** that retrieves and displays **real time weather information** for user‑specified locations.  
Key features include:  
- Ability to input or select a location and fetch current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).  
- User interface that presents weather data clearly and in an accessible format.  
- Integration with an external weather API to obtain up‑to‑date weather information.
