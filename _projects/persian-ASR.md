This project is completed.

In this project, we developed a **Persian language ASR system** using the Whisper speech‑to‑text model by OpenAI.  
Key features include:  
- Fine‑tuning the Whisper model on Persian speech datasets to recognize and transcribe Farsi audio and video accurately.  
- Deploying a pipeline for processing Persian audio and video, including preprocessing, model inference, and evaluation of transcription errors.  
- Supporting automatic speech recognition for Persian applications such as voice assistants, transcription services, and research tools.
